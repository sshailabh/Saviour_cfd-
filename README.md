 The goal of this app is to create the world's largest, most reliable, all-hazard disaster alerting network by combining data from global institutions and data providers with crowd-sourced user accounts. Our global emergency warning platform validates the reliability of the reported content and then immediately alerts those who may be impacted, depending on the severity and location.
With data collected from both verified sources and users like ours, we will instantly have access to everything we need to know about an event. Alerts contain basic event details, impact statistics, maps, images, videos, and more.We can instantly share alerts with friends and family members to get them out of harm’s way via email, Facebook and Twitter.It would help in creating a global social network that will operate to save lives by sharing the knowledge of the world's citizens with those in danger. 
In the wake of the recent mega disasters (Indian Ocean Tsunami, Japan Earthquake/Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, etc...) and numerous man-made fiascos (SARs scare, Terrorist Attacks, etc…), it's become painfully obvious that the existing alert systems aren't enough. These events claimed more innocent lives than they had to, and we've been wondering why. We would think our cities, states, and countries would have figured out a better way to warn us by now. But this is not the case.


Why doesn't this exist already?
Three reasons:
- The disaster information is simply not known (not enough reporters and instruments on the ground yet);
- Governments and institutions are reluctant to alert citizens (some fear liability, some fear panic, and others, because they are irresponsible);
- The problem is hard to solve: how do we know who and when to alert in such a complex global village?



How does it work?
All people will have to do is to tell us what is happening, where, how serious the event is, and how large the impact area could be. Then, we will check to see who may be within the impact area they designed and is interested in the alert, and we will send them an alert! 


Basic Features will include:
- Interactive map
- Sort events by severity / popularity / location 
- Report an event and submit a photo
- Share events by email, or post links to Facebook and Twitter
- Save alerts to your “watch” list for quick viewing
- Adjust text size
- Provide feedback regarding credibility of the post to prevent fraudulent posts
- Adjust settings to display distance in kilometers or miles
